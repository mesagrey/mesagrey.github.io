## Chromakopia Album Review
#### Published on: {{ page.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}

Tyler, The Creator's new album, Chromakopia, takes listeners on a colorful and thoughtful exploration of his mind. It features a unique blend of styles and daring sound experiments, highlighting Tyler's growth as an artist and producer.

Chromakopia marks a drastic shift from his earlier sounds, embracing a more experimental and psychedelic vibe. The album offers a dynamic listening experience, moving from dreamy and atmospheric sounds to lively and intense beats. Songs like "Darling, I" and "Tomorrow" reveal Tyler's gentle side with soft vocals and enchanting production, while tracks like "Rah Tah Tah" and "Thought I Was Dead" showcase his fierce energy and powerful delivery.

A standout track is "Sticky", a track featuring Lil Wayne, GloRilla and Sexxy Red that combines a catchy hook with intricate production and clever wordplay.

Tyler's skillful lyrics shine throughout the album. He explores topics like self-exploration, the dark side of fame, and the intricacies of relationships. His reflective lyrics are often combined with clever wordplay and sharp insights.

Although Chromakopia is an ambitious and bold work, it has some shortcomings. Certain tracks might feel disconnected or lack unity, and its experimental style may not resonate with everyone. Still, for those open to its diverse sounds, Chromakopia offers a fulfilling listening journey.

My favorite tracks:

- Darling, I
- Sticky
- Like Him

Rating: 8.5/10.
